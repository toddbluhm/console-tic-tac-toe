### Console Tic Tac Toe

This is a programming test project I built as a very quick demonstration of my
skills to a company.

## Installation

`npm install` in project directory

## Usage

`npm start` - View the current console help message

`npm start -- -p` - Start a new tic tac toe game

`npm start -- -s` - Displays the current high scores list

## Scoring

Scoring is based on 3 parameters
- Winner/Loser (no score if you lose)
- Number of moves to win
- How long did it take in seconds to win

Higher scores are better.
